# Summary
In this project, I performed data cleaning and exploratory analysis on the Telco Customer Churn dataset using R. The workflow included importing and cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, converting variables to appropriate types, and creating visualizations to analyze customer churn. I calculated the overall churn rate, analyzed churn by contract type, and examined churn patterns across different monthly charge groups. The project provides insights into customer behavior, highlights key factors related to churn, and serves as a foundation for predictive modeling and customer retention strategies.

# Key Insights
1. The overall churn rate is 26.6%, meaning that roughly one in four customers left the company. This indicates a moderate level of customer attrition and highlights the importance of retention strategies to reduce churn and maintain a stable customer base.

2. In this chart, the churn rate decreases significantly as the contract duration increases:
* Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate, 42.7%, indicating that customers on this type of contract are much more likely to cancel;
* One-year contracts have a reduced churn of 11.3%, showing higher retention;
* Two-year contracts show a very low churn, only 2.8%, indicating that long-term contracts retain customers much more effectively.

The main insight I can identify is that customers with longer contracts exhibit significantly higher retention, while month-to-month contracts are associated with a much higher risk of churn.
