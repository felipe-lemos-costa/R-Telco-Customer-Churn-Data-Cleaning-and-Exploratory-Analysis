# Summary
TIn this project, I performed data cleaning and exploratory analysis on the Telco Customer Churn dataset using R. The workflow included importing and cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, converting variables to appropriate types, and creating visualizations to analyze customer churn. I calculated the overall churn rate, analyzed churn by contract type, and examined churn patterns across different monthly charge groups. The project provides insights into customer behavior, highlights key factors related to churn, and serves as a foundation for predictive modeling and customer retention strategies.
